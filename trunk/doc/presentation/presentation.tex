\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{columns}[c] % the "c" option specifies center vertical alignment
\column{.5\textwidth} % column designated by a command
\begin{itemize}
  \item Wish to better represent range of opacities
  \item Increasing number of groups will not increase ``opacity resolution'' at
	 transition lines
  \item Opacity Distribution Function (ODF) method allows each group to have
	 multiple opacities
  \item Implement ODFs in Milagro
  \item Improve ODF method with better frequency-dependence for improved physics
\end{itemize}
