 ============================== ABOUT THIS FILE ==============================

At major revisions, timing tests (i.e. in the examples file) should be run to
assess whether the performance has changed significantly between revisions.
Since the purpose of this library is for scientific computing, execution speed
is of the highest priority.

meshTiming is a good test of the overhead inherent in the geometry code itself,
and meshComparison is a good test of a real monte carlo code.

Variations in the system between one run and another should prevent these
results from being more accurate than maybe 10%, so they are probably nearly
worthless.
