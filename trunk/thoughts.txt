In the process of finding the region on the other side (R') of a surface S from
the initial region R:
- reverse R's sense of S to get the sense that the "opposite side" region R' 	
  will have of S
- loop only through regions that have that opposite sense
	- when checking "am I inside" for each region, loop over all surfaces that
	  are *not* the surface being crossed (since you already know you're
	  "inside" that surface)
