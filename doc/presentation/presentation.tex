\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{columns}[c] % the "c" option specifies center vertical alignment
\column{.5\textwidth} % column designated by a command
\begin{itemize}
  \item Wish to better represent range of opacities
  \item Increasing number of groups will not increase ``opacity resolution'' at
	 transition lines
  \item Opacity Distribution Function (ODF) method allows each group to have
	 multiple opacities
  \item Implement ODFs in Milagro
  \item Improve ODF method with better frequency-dependence for improved physics
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
	 \item Our geometry works (assuming our test codes are complete)
     \item It isn't terribly difficult to implement
         \begin{itemize}
             \item We implemented the geometry code in half a semester
             \item But you don't have to!   http://code.google.com/p/mcgeometry
         \end{itemize}
     \item Caching connectivity improves runtime
     \item Better than doing the last homework assignment
         \begin{itemize}
             \item Takes more time, but â€¦
             \item Is more useful in the long run
         \end{itemize}
	 \item We deserve an A+ (of course!)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
	 \item Write connections to a file
	 \item Parallelism issues
   \item Further optimization tricks
  \end{itemize}
