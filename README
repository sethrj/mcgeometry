===== To build =====

Download cmake and install it from
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Create a build directory outside of the source directory (e.g., ../_buildmcg)
and cd to it (cd ../_buildmcg)

    mkdir ../_buildmcg
    cd ../_buildmcg

Run cmake in the build directory; pass in the path to the mcgeometry source
directory. Configure it once to see the build options (if using ccmake or
cmake-gui), and change them as desired.

	cmake ../mcgeometry-source

Compile using the makefile it generated. (Depending on what you told CMake, it
might have created an XCode or Eclipse project instead of using make's build
system. In most cases on a UNIXy system, make is the default.)

    make check
